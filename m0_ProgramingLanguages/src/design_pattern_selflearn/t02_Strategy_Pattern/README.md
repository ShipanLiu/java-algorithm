# Strategy Pattern

1. The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one of them, and makes them interchangeable. The pattern allows the algorithm to vary independently from the clients that use it.

2. In other words, **the Strategy Pattern allows you to define multiple ways of performing an operation (the strategies), and then choose the most appropriate one at runtime**.
