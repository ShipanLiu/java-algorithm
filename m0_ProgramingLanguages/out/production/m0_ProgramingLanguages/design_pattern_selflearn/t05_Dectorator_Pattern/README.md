# Dectorator Pattern

The Decorator Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to add new functionalities to existing objects without altering their structure. This is achieved by creating a set of decorator classes that are used to wrap concrete components. Decorator classes mirror the type of the components they decorate but add or override behavior.
